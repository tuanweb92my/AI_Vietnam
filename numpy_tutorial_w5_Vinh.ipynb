    "\n",
    "A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can initialize numpy arrays from nested Python lists, and access elements using square brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # Create a rank 1 array\n",
    "print(type(a))            # Prints \"<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\"\n",
    "print(a.shape)            # Prints \"(3,)\"\n",
    "print(a[0], a[1], a[2])   # Prints \"1 2 3\"\n",
    "a[0] = 5                  # Change an element of the array\n",
    "print(a)                  # Prints \"[5, 2, 3]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])    # Create a rank 2 array\n",
    "print(b.shape)                     # Prints \"(2, 3)\"\n",
    "print(b[0, 0], b[0, 1], b[1, 0])   # Prints \"1 2 4\"\n",

    "### Array indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy offers several ways to index into arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing: Similar to Python lists, numpy arrays can be sliced. Since arrays may be multidimensional, you must specify a slice for each dimension of the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the following rank 2 array with shape (3, 4)\n",
    "# [[ 1  2  3  4]\n",
    "#  [ 5  6  7  8]\n",
    "#  [ 9 10 11 12]]\n",
    "a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use slicing to pull out the subarray consisting of the first 2 rows\n",
    "# and columns 1 and 2; b is the following array of shape (2, 2):\n",
    "# [[2 3]\n",
    "#  [6 7]]\n",
    "b = a[:2, 1:3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# A slice of an array is a view into the same data, so modifying it\n",
    "# will modify the original array.\n",
    "print(a[0, 1])   # Prints \"2\"\n",
    "b[0, 0] = 77     # b[0, 0] is the same piece of data as a[0, 1]\n",
    "print(a[0, 1])   # Prints \"77\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also mix integer indexing with slice indexing. However, doing so will yield an array of lower rank than the original array. Note that this is quite different from the way that MATLAB handles array slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the following rank 2 array with shape (3, 4)\n",
    "# [[ 1  2  3  4]\n",
    "#  [ 5  6  7  8]\n",
    "#  [ 9 10 11 12]]\n",
    "a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Two ways of accessing the data in the middle row of the array.\n",
    "# Mixing integer indexing with slices yields an array of lower rank,\n",
    "# while using only slices yields an array of the same rank as the\n",
    "# original array:\n",
    "row_r1 = a[1, :]    # Rank 1 view of the second row of a\n",
    "row_r2 = a[1:2, :]  # Rank 2 view of the second row of a\n",
    "print(row_r1, row_r1.shape)  # Prints \"[5 6 7 8] (4,)\"\n",
    "print(row_r2, row_r2.shape)  # Prints \"[[5 6 7 8]] (1, 4)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can make the same distinction when accessing columns of an array:\n",
    "col_r1 = a[:, 1]\n",
    "col_r2 = a[:, 1:2]\n",
    "print(col_r1, col_r1.shape)  # Prints \"[ 2  6 10] (3,)\"\n",
    "print(col_r2, col_r2.shape)  # Prints \"[[ 2]\n",
    "                             #          [ 6]\n",
    "                             #          [10]] (3, 1)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer array indexing: When you index into numpy arrays using slicing, the resulting array view will always be a subarray of the original array. In contrast, integer array indexing allows you to construct arbitrary arrays using the data from another array. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# An example of integer array indexing.\n",
    "# The returned array will have shape (3,) and\n",
    "print(a[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]])  # Prints \"[1 4 5]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# The above example of integer array indexing is equivalent to this:\n",
    "print(np.array([a[0, 0], a[1, 1], a[2, 0]]))  # Prints \"[1 4 5]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# When using integer array indexing, you can reuse the same\n",
    "# element from the source array:\n",
    "print(a[[0, 0], [1, 1]])  # Prints \"[2 2]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equivalent to the previous integer array indexing example\n",
    "print(np.array([a[0, 1], a[0, 1]]))  # Prints \"[2 2]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful trick with integer array indexing is selecting or mutating one element from each row of a matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new array from which we will select elements\n",
    "a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a)  # prints \"array([[ 1,  2,  3],\n",
    "          #                [ 4,  5,  6],\n",
    "          #                [ 7,  8,  9],\n",
    "          #                [10, 11, 12]])\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an array of indices\n",
    "b = np.array([0, 2, 0, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select one element from each row of a using the indices in b\n",
    "print(a[np.arange(4), b])  # Prints \"[ 1  6  7 11]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutate one element from each row of a using the indices in b\n",
    "a[np.arange(4), b] += 10\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a)  # prints \"array([[11,  2,  3],\n",
    "          #                [ 4,  5, 16],\n",
    "          #                [17,  8,  9],\n",
    "          #                [10, 21, 12]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean array indexing: Boolean array indexing lets you pick out arbitrary elements of an array. Frequently this type of indexing is used to select the elements of an array that satisfy some condition. Here is an example:\n",

    "                     # shape as a, where each slot of bool_idx tells\n",
    "                     # whether that element of a is > 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bool_idx)      # Prints \"[[False False]\n",
    "                     #          [ True  True]\n",

    "### Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Every numpy array is a grid of elements of the same type. Numpy provides a large set of numeric datatypes that you can use to construct arrays. Numpy tries to guess a datatype when you create an array, but functions that construct arrays usually also include an optional argument to explicitly specify the datatype. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "x = np.array([1.0, 2.0])   # Let numpy choose the datatype\n",
    "print(x.dtype)             # Prints \"float64\"\n",

    "This works; however when the matrix `x` is very large, computing an explicit loop in Python could be slow.

    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute outer product of vectors\n",
    "v = np.array([1,2,3])  # v has shape (3,)\n",
    "w = np.array([4,5])    # w has shape (2,)\n",
    "# To compute an outer product, we first reshape v to be a column\n",
    "# vector of shape (3, 1); we can then broadcast it against w to yield\n",
    "# an output of shape (3, 2), which is the outer product of v and w:\n",
    "# [[ 4  5]\n",
    "#  [ 8 10]\n",
    "#  [12 15]]\n",

    "### SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays. SciPy builds on this, and provides a large number of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Image operations\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy provides some basic functions to work with images. For example, it has functions to read images from disk into numpy arrays, to write numpy arrays to disk as images, and to resize images. Here is a simple example that showcases these functions:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# We can tint the image by scaling each of the color channels\n",
    "# by a different scalar constant. The image has shape (400, 248, 3);\n",
    "# we multiply it by the array [1, 0.95, 0.9] of shape (3,);\n",
    "# numpy broadcasting means that this leaves the red channel unchanged,\n",
    "# and multiplies the green and blue channels by 0.95 and 0.9\n",
    "# respectively.\n",
    "img_tinted = img * [1, 0.95, 0.9]\n",
    "\n",
